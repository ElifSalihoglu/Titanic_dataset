## Project Overview
In this project, we are working with the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers based on the features available in the dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features, and several preprocessing steps are taken:
- Missing values are handled.
- Categorical features such as 'Sex' and 'Embarked' are converted to numerical values.
- Feature scaling techniques are applied to normalize the numerical features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA phase, we:
- Visualize the distribution of numerical features such as 'Age' and 'Fare'.
- Analyze the correlation between different features.
- Investigate the survival rate based on categorical features such as 'Pclass', 'Sex', and 'Embarked'.

## Feature Engineering
- We create new features and modify existing ones to improve model performance.
- Categorical features are encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- Numerical features are standardized using MinMax scaling or robust scaling.

## Model Building
We use logistic regression to predict the survival of passengers. The model is evaluated using cross-validation, and performance metrics like accuracy are calculated.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, perform exploratory data analysis, engineer features, and build a predictive model using logistic regression. The insights gained from the analysis guide the feature selection and model building process.
